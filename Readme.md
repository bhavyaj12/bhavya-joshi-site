Hi, I am Bhavya.
This is my website to showcase my portfolio on my journey to learn full stack development and become a better coder. It is for me to rediscover the love of coding that I had lost. It's coming tomorrow when I learn HTML and CSS with Tanay Pratap on Youtube.

For now I know:

1. JavaScript
1. Node.js
1. Repl.it
1. Chalk
